Self-Prompt: Thorough Testing for Removal of GITHUB_TOKEN in github_codex_bridge.py

Objective:
- Verify that github_codex_bridge.py no longer uses the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
- Ensure the bridge service functions correctly without the token.
- Confirm that GitHub API calls made by this bridge authenticate properly or handle missing tokens gracefully.

Testing Steps:

1. Code Review
- Confirm the github_codex_bridge.py code does not read or use GITHUB_TOKEN.
- Check for fallback or error handling when token is missing.

2. Unit Tests
- Run existing unit tests for github_codex_bridge.py.
- Add tests to simulate missing or empty token scenarios.
- Verify expected behavior (e.g., error messages, alternative auth).

3. Integration Tests
- Test bridge service interactions with GitHub API without GITHUB_TOKEN.
- Confirm API calls succeed if possible or fail gracefully.

4. Environment Verification
- Ensure no GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set during tests.
- Confirm bridge service does not rely on environment token.

5. CI/CD Pipeline
- Check CI/CD workflows for any references to GITHUB_TOKEN.
- Run pipeline to verify no failures related to token removal.

6. Logging and Monitoring
- Review logs for authentication errors or warnings.
- Confirm no unexpected failures due to missing token.

7. Documentation
- Update documentation to reflect token removal.
- Note any changes in authentication requirements.

Deliverables:
- Test reports covering all above steps.
- Updated or new test cases.
- Documentation updates.

This self-prompt guides thorough testing to ensure robust removal of GITHUB_TOKEN usage in github_codex_bridge.py.
