Self-Prompt: Environment Setup for Resolving Import Errors in Python Project

Objective:
- Identify and set up the correct Python environment and dependencies to resolve import errors for modules such as services.ai_providers_simple, models.agent, flask, and routes.

Steps:

1. Identify Python Environment
- Determine if a virtual environment (venv, conda) is used.
- If not, create a virtual environment for project isolation.

2. Dependency Management
- Locate dependency files (requirements.txt, Pipfile, pyproject.toml).
- Install dependencies using pip or appropriate package manager.

3. Source Path Configuration
- Ensure the 'src' directory is included in PYTHONPATH or sys.path.
- Adjust test files to correctly import modules relative to 'src'.

4. Flask and Other External Packages
- Verify Flask and other external packages are installed in the environment.
- Install missing packages via pip.

5. Verify Imports
- Run Python interpreter or test runner to confirm imports resolve.
- Fix any remaining path or package issues.

6. Documentation
- Document environment setup steps for future reference.

Deliverables:
- Working Python environment with all dependencies installed.
- Resolved import errors in test files and source code.
- Documentation of setup process.

This self-prompt guides systematic environment setup to fix import resolution issues.
