- ✅ **Session management** with conversation history

### 3. **Sandboxed Code Execution**
```python
class SandboxExecutor:
    - Secure Python code execution
    - Timeout protection (10 seconds)
    - Isolated environment
    - Real-time output streaming
    - Error handling and reporting
```

### 4. **Professional UI Components**
- **Monaco Editor**: Full code editing with IntelliSense
- **Agent Cards**: Real-time status of all 5 AI agents
- **A2A Console**: Live communication feed between agents
- **Terminal**: Interactive command execution
- **Chat Interface**: Natural language project description
- **Consensus Dashboard**: Real-time agreement tracking

## 🧠 **A2A Framework Architecture**

### **Agent Roles & Models:**
1. **Planner Agent** → `thudm/glm-z1-32b-0414`
   - Project analysis and breakdown
   - Technical requirements planning
   - Architecture design

2. **Coder Agent** → `qwen/qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct`
   - Code implementation
   - Feature development
   - Bug fixing

3. **Reviewer Agent** → `blackboxai/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b`
   - Code quality assessment
   - Security review
   - Performance optimization

4. **Tester Agent** → `google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking`
   - Test generation
   - Validation and verification
   - Quality assurance

5. **Coordinator Agent** → `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`
   - Task orchestration
   - Consensus facilitation
   - Multi-agent coordination

### **Communication Flow:**
```
User Input → Coordinator → Planner → Coder → Reviewer → Consensus → Result
                ↓                                           ↑
            Real-time A2A Messages              Agent Agreement
```
