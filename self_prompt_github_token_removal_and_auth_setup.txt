Self-Prompt: Systematic and Semantic Approach to Remove GITHUB_TOKEN and Setup GitHub CLI Authentication on Ubuntu

Objective:
- Ensure complete removal of GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable references from all project files and environment.
- Setup GitHub CLI authentication (gh auth login) on Ubuntu to store credentials securely.
- Perform thorough testing to verify removal and authentication setup.

Steps:

1. Recursive Search and Removal
- Recursively search all project files and environment configurations for any references to GITHUB_TOKEN.
- Remove or sanitize any found references, including .env files, shell scripts, CI/CD workflows, Docker/Kubernetes configs.
- Verify no residual references remain.

2. Environment Cleanup
- Unset GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable in all relevant shell profiles (.bashrc, .profile, .zshrc).
- Remove any exported or set commands related to GITHUB_TOKEN.

3. GitHub CLI Authentication Setup on Ubuntu
- Install GitHub CLI if not already installed.
- Run `gh auth login` interactively to authenticate and store credentials.
- Verify authentication status with `gh auth status`.

4. Testing
- Verify no GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set in the shell.
- Confirm GitHub CLI uses stored credentials for authentication.
- Test GitHub CLI commands (e.g., `gh repo list`, `gh issue list`) to ensure proper authentication.
- Check CI/CD pipelines and scripts to confirm no reliance on GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.

5. Documentation and Scripts
- Document the removal and setup process.
- Provide scripts to automate environment cleanup and GitHub CLI authentication setup.

6. Continuous Monitoring
- Add checks in CI/CD to prevent usage of GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
- Monitor authentication failures related to token usage.

Deliverables:
- Cleaned project with no GITHUB_TOKEN references.
- Scripts for environment cleanup and GitHub CLI setup.
- Documentation of the process.
- Test reports confirming successful removal and authentication.

This self-prompt guides the systematic and semantic approach to fully address the task.
