Self-Prompt: Sequential Semantic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with Reverse Decomposition to Isolate and Fix GitHub CLI Authentication Login Problem

Goal:
- Isolate the root cause of the GitHub CLI (gh) authentication login issue.
- Fix the problem to enable successful gh auth login without relying on the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.

Step 1: Understand the Problem Context
- The gh auth login command is stuck or not completing as expected.
- The environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN may still be set or interfering.
- The CLI may be caching old credentials or environment settings.

Step 2: Reverse Decomposition of the Problem
- Identify all sources where GITHUB_TOKEN could be set (shell, IDE, system environment).
- Check for any cached credentials or config files used by GitHub CLI.
- Verify the current environment variables in the shell session.
- Confirm the version of GitHub CLI and its configuration.

Step 3: Sequential Steps to Isolate the Issue
- Clear GITHUB_TOKEN from all environment sources.
- Clear GitHub CLI cached credentials and config.
- Restart the shell or IDE to ensure clean environment.
- Run gh auth login with verbose/debug mode to capture detailed logs.
- Analyze logs for errors or blocking points.

Step 4: Fix Implementation
- Remove or unset GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable permanently.
- Remove or reset GitHub CLI config and cache if corrupted.
- Ensure no conflicting environment variables or config files.
- Re-run gh auth login and verify success.

Step 5: Verification and Testing
- Confirm gh auth status shows authenticated user.
- Test GitHub CLI commands requiring authentication.
- Validate no environment variable dependency.

Step 6: Documentation and Automation
- Document the fix steps and environment cleanup.
- Create scripts to automate environment cleanup and gh auth login.

This self-prompt guides a systematic, semantic, and stepwise approach to isolate and fix the GitHub CLI authentication login problem using reverse decomposition and chain-of-thought reasoning.
